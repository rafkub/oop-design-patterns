# Object-relational mapping (ORM)
* a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems
  using object-oriented programming languages
  * relational databases are not object-oriented,
    thus the object values need to be converted into groups of simpler values
    for storage in the database and converted back upon retrieval
