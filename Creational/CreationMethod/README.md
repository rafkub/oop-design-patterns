# Creation Method
* a method that creates objects
* a wrapper around a constructor call

## Benefits
* name that better expresses intentions
* several Creation Methods may have different purposes - in PHP in particular 
  it overcomes a limitation of having only one constructor
  
## Drawbacks
* requires instantiation using a constructor first

## Gotchas
* Do not confuse with Factory Method.
  Every *result* of the Factory Method pattern is a Creation Method but not the other way round
